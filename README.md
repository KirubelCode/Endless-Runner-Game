x68 Endless Runner Game
An x68 Assembly-based endless runner, inspired by Geometry Dash, where the player must jump over obstacles to survive. The game includes background music, jump mechanics, lives system, and an automatic restart upon losing.

About the Game
- The player (a box) moves forward automatically.
- The player must jump over obstacles to avoid losing lives.
- If all lives are lost, the game ends but restarts when any key is pressed.
- Background music enhances gameplay.
- The original template only included the ground and player box—all game mechanics were coded manually (jumping, movement, lives, restart, music, etc.).
